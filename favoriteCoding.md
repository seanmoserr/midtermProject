#Favorite Coding Elements

Coding is a lot of fun. We're going to be working with some `variables`.

    //let's look at one of my favorite ways to go through a loop!
    //and calculate an average of array elements!
    
    //initalize variables
    int array[] = [4, 3, 99, 45, 32, 10, 3];
    int sum = 0;
    int average = 0;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
    {
        sum += array[i]
    }
    
    average = sum / array.Length;
    
    
Here's another cool example of C# programming!

Here is an _example_ of a C# program that utilizes [classes](https://github.com/seanmoserr/midtermProject/blob/main/Program.cs).
