# Thank You / Directory
## Thank you for visiting my Midterm Project Page! 

This project was compiled using markdown (.md) files on [GitHub](github.com). This assignment helped me to practice using markdown in order to easily create webpages that can be represetned in HTML format.
Attached and linked into this project are various pages that reflect information about myself and programming.
